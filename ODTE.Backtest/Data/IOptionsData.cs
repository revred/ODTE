/// <summary>
/// Abstraction over options chain data and volatility surface.
/// WHY: Separates options data source from strategy logic, enabling prototype â†’ production migration.
/// 
/// PROTOTYPE MODE: Synthetic options generated from SPX spot + VIX/VIX9D proxies
/// PRODUCTION MODE: Real intraday chains from ORATS/LiveVol/dxFeed with actual Greeks
/// 
/// CRITICAL FOR 0DTE TRADING:
/// - Accurate Greeks (especially Delta) for strike selection
/// - Real-time quotes for entry/exit decisions
/// - Implied volatility for regime assessment
/// - Liquidity metrics (bid-ask spreads) for execution quality
/// 
/// 0DTE OPTIONS CHARACTERISTICS:
/// - Extreme time decay (theta burn)
/// - High gamma (accelerating delta)
/// - Wide bid-ask spreads near expiration
/// - Limited strike availability
/// - PM cash settlement for SPX/XSP
///

    /// IV TERM STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
    /// - VIX9D > VIX: Near-term stress (avoid new positions)
    /// - VIX9D < VIX: Calm near-term conditions (favorable for premium selling)
    /// - Both rising: General market stress
    /// - Both falling: Complacency conditions
    /// 
    /// STRATEGY INTEGRATION:
    /// - High IV: Better credit collection but higher gamma risk
    /// - Low IV: Lower credits but more predictable behavior
    /// - IV skew: Puts typically trade at higher IV than calls (equity fear premium)
