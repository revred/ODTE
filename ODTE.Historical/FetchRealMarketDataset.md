# 📊 20-Year Historical Data Acquisition - Implementation Guide

## 🎯 **PROJECT OBJECTIVE**
Acquire comprehensive, traceable, production-grade historical options data for 20 years to support ODTE strategy development, backtesting, and optimization.

---

## 📋 **CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**

### ✅ **What We Have**
```yaml
Existing Data:
  SPY/VIX Data: 2005-2020 (15 years) - Yahoo Finance quality
  XSP Options: 2025 YTD (~75 days) - Parquet format
  Synthetic Data: High-quality generated data for testing
  Database: SQLite with 5-year consolidated database

Current Gaps:
  - No real options data for 2005-2024 (19 years missing)
  - Limited to SPY underlying, need SPX direct
  - No intraday granularity for most periods
  - No validation pipeline for data quality
  - No institutional-grade data sources
```

### 🎯 **Target State**
```yaml
Required Dataset:
  Time Range: 2005-2025 (20 years)
  Symbols: SPY, SPX, XSP options + underlying
  Granularity: Intraday (minute-level preferred)
  Quality: Institutional grade with validation
  Coverage: Full options chain for 0DTE strategies
  Size Estimate: ~500GB-2TB total dataset
```

    Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Timestamp DATETIME NOT NULL,
    Symbol VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    Expiration DATE NOT NULL,
    Strike DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    OptionType CHAR(1) CHECK (OptionType IN ('C', 'P')),
    Bid DECIMAL(10,4),
    Ask DECIMAL(10,4), 
    Last DECIMAL(10,4),
    Volume INTEGER,
    OpenInterest INTEGER,
    ImpliedVolatility DECIMAL(8,6),

    Theta DECIMAL(8,6),
    Vega DECIMAL(8,6),
    UnderlyingPrice DECIMAL(10,4),

    IngestionTime DATETIME,
    IsValidated BOOLEAN,
    
    UNIQUE(Timestamp, Symbol, Expiration, Strike, OptionType)

-- Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_options_date_symbol ON OptionsHistorical(Timestamp, Symbol);
CREATE INDEX idx_options_expiration ON OptionsHistorical(Expiration);
```

### **Quality Monitoring Pipeline**
```csharp
// Automated quality checks
public class DataQualityMonitor
{
    // Real-time validation
    public async Task<QualityReport> ValidateIncomingData(DataBatch batch)
    {
        var checks = new List<QualityCheck>
        {
            new PriceValidityCheck(),      // Bid <= Ask, positive prices
            new GreeksValidityCheck(),     // Delta [-1,1], Gamma >= 0
            new VolumeValidityCheck(),     // Non-negative volume/OI
            new TemporalValidityCheck(),   // Expiration > timestamp
            new CrossReferenceCheck()      // Consistency across sources
        };
        
        return await RunQualityChecks(batch, checks);
    }
}
```
