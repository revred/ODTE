# 🚀 ODTE Strategy Improvement Roadmap - Battle-Tested Enhancements

## 📋 Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of trading performance across March 2021, May 2022, and June 2025, this roadmap provides a systematic approach to enhance the PM250 trading system. The improvements are organized into tiers with measurable validation criteria and focused on capital preservation, profit optimization, and risk management.

---

## 🎯 Tier A — Guardrails & Capital Preservation (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)

### **A1: Per-Trade Max-Loss Tied to RFib Daily Budget**
**Change:** Before order execution, reject if `MaxLossAtEntry > f × RemainingDailyRFibBudget` (start with f=0.40)

**Why it Generalizes:** Budget-proportional caps are regime-agnostic; they bound tail losses consistently across calm and volatile markets.

**Effort/Impact:** Low / Very High

**Validation Criteria:**
- No daily RFib budget breaches
- Weekly max drawdown ↓ 25-40%
- Risk-of-ruin ↓ 50%+
- Trade utilization ≥ 70% of baseline

---

### **A2: Integer Contract Sizing + Absolute Per-Trade Contract Cap**
**Change:** Floor to whole contracts; compute cap from per-trade loss allowance and width; enforce `min(derivedCap, HardCap)`

**Why:** Removes hidden leverage drift; universal across all underlyings and market conditions.

**Effort/Impact:** Low / High

**Validation Criteria:**
- Zero non-integer position sizes
- Position size distribution compresses
- Tail losses shrink ≥ 30%
- P&L degradation < 5%

---

### **A3: Liquidity & Slippage Hard Floors (No Overrides)**
**Change:** Require `minLiquidityScore`, `maxQuotedSpread%`, `minDepth@TopN`; route with limit at mid ± ticks; cancel if worse

**Why:** Transaction-cost discipline provides consistent edge across all market regimes.

**Effort/Impact:** Low / High

**Validation Criteria:**
- Slippage median & 90th percentile ↓ 40%+
- Fill rate ≥ 80% of baseline
- Net P&L per trade ↑ 10-15%

---

### **A4: Adaptive Stop Multiple by Width & IV**
**Change:** `StopMultiple = 1.6–2.2` mapped by `(Width, IVRank, TTE)`. Narrow+low-IV → tighter; wide+high-IV → looser

**Why:** Normalizes risk across volatility states; prevents single-setting overfitting.

**Effort/Impact:** Low / Medium-High

**Validation Criteria:**
- Average loss on losing trades ↓ 20% across all IV regimes
- Win rate stable (±2%)
- Profit factor ↑ or flat

---

### **A5: Daily/Weekly Kill-Switch Hierarchy (Enhanced RFib)**
**Change:** Day cap via RFib; weekly cap = 3× day cap; auto-cooldown until next profitable day

**Why:** Time-scoped containment prevents bleed-out clusters universally.

**Effort/Impact:** Low / High

**Validation Criteria:**
- "Red cluster" frequency ↓ 60%
- Zero weekly cap breaches
- CAGR maintained or improved

---

## 🎯 Tier B — Entry Economics (Raise Average Profit/Trade)

### **B1: Dynamic Credit Floor by Width & IV**
**Change:** `MinCredit = max(α·Width, β·IVRank·Width)` (start α=0.18, β=0.04)

### **B2: Strike Selection by Target Delta + Skew Sanity**
**Change:** Choose wings via target short-delta; adjust for local skew for efficient credit/width

### **B3: Microstructure-Aware Entry Windows**
**Change:** Only trade during stable spread/latency windows; ban churny periods unless liquidity ≥ high watermark

---

## 🎯 Tier C — Utilization Without Extra Risk

### **C1: GoScore Lanes (Probe/Standard/Full)**
**Change:** Graduated exposure: ≥70 Full, 50-69 Standard, 35-49 Probe, <35 No-trade

### **C2: Defensive-Mode Structure Switch**
**Change:** In hostile regimes, switch to tighter defined-risk structures instead of complete blackout

---

## 🎯 Tier D — Exits (Lift Winners, Cap Time Decay Risk)

### **D1: Two-Tier Take-Profit (Runner Logic)**
**Change:** High GoScore trades use 60%/40% profit-taking; lower GoScore use 40%/60% split

### **D2: Time-Based Exit If Stagnating**
**Change:** Exit if <10% profit by T-90 minutes to expiry

---

## 🎯 Tier E — Observability & Test Harness

### **E1: Feature Flags + Shadow Metrics**
### **E2: Regime-Stratified Dashboards**

---

## 🎯 Tier F — Anti-Overfit Validation Protocol

### **F1: Walk-Forward Tuning**
### **F2: Purged Time-Series CV + Sensitivity Sweeps**
### **F3: Stress Tests (Syntricks Integration)**

---

## 📊 Acceptance Gates (Applied After Each Tier)

### **Risk Gates:**
- No increase in max daily/weekly drawdown
- Expected Shortfall (ES95) ↓ or flat
- Risk-of-ruin ↓

### **Return Gates:**
- Average profit/trade ≥ +20% vs baseline
- Monthly net P&L ↑ with 95% confidence interval overlap

### **Utilization Gates:**
- Executed opportunity rate ↑ or flat
- No increase in tail risk

### **Cost Gates:**
- Slippage & commission share of gross P&L ↓ or flat
