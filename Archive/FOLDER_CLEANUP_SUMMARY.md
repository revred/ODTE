**Cleanup Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Objective:** Remove scattered Reports and TestResults folders from root directory

## ✅ **Completed Actions**

### 🗑️ **Removed from Root Directory:**
- ❌ `Reports/` - Eliminated root-level reports folder
- ❌ `TestResults/` - Eliminated root-level test results folder  
- ❌ `Consolidated/` - Removed temporary consolidation folder

### 📂 **Restored to Project Locations:**

- ✅ `Archive/TestResults/` - Legacy test results and code coverage reports

## 📊 **Final Structure**

Each project now maintains its own reports in the standard location:
```
ODTE.Backtest/Reports/          # Backtesting outputs
ODTE.Optimization/Reports/      # Genetic algorithm results  
Options.Start/Reports/          # Blazor PWA reports
ODTE.Strategy.Tests/TestResults/ # Unit test outputs
Archive/                        # Historical data preservation
```

## 🎯 **Benefits Achieved**

- **Clean Root:** No more scattered report folders in root directory
- **Project Isolation:** Each project manages its own outputs
- **Data Preservation:** All historical data safely archived
