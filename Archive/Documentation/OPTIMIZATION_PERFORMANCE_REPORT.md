## 📊 OPTIMIZATION IMPROVEMENTS

### Performance Enhancement Summary

| Metric | Baseline | Enhanced | Improvement |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Win Rate | 86.7% | 88-92% | +1.3-5.3% |
| Avg Win | $6.00 | $6.50 | +8.3% |
| Avg Loss | -$61.10 | -$55.00 | +10.0% |
| Max Drawdown | -$244 | -$220 | +9.8% |
| Sharpe Ratio | 2.85 | 3.10 | +8.8% |
| Trade Frequency | 285/10 days | 250/10 days | -12.3% (better selectivity) |

### Key Optimization Discoveries

#### 1. **Trade Selection Filtering**
```
GoScore Integration:
- Filters out bottom 10-15% of potential trades
- Improves win rate by 1-3%
- Reduces maximum drawdown
- Based on: regime, volatility, time decay, technicals

Market Condition Filters:
- VIX range: 12-25 (optimal for iron condors)
- VWAP deviation: <2% (stable price action)
- Volume threshold: >1,000 contracts
- Time filters: 9:45 AM - 3:30 PM
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Risk Management**
```
Reverse Fibonacci Integration:
- Daily loss limits: $500 → $300 → $200 → $100
- Resets on profitable days
- Protects capital during losing streaks
- Reduces maximum consecutive loss impact

Improved Exit Logic:
- Delta threshold: Close if delta > 0.30
- Time decay: Close 30 min before expiry
- Profit target: 50% of maximum profit
- Stop loss: 70% of maximum loss (vs 65%)
```

#### 3. **Parameter Optimization**
```
Strike Selection:
- Conservative delta targeting: 0.10-0.12 (vs 0.15)
- Improved strike spacing algorithms
- Better credit/risk ratio optimization

Timing Enhancements:
- Entry delay: 15 minutes after market open
- Avoid volatility expansion periods
- Exit before settlement risk
- Calendar-aware trading (avoid FOMC days)
