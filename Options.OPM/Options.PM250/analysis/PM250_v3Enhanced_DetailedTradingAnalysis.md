#### **Win Rate Drop Analysis (82.9% ‚Üí 66.7%)**

**Primary Factors:**

1. **Market Evolution Effects**
   - Evolved market patterns not fully captured in parameters
   - Traditional 0DTE behaviors changed
   - Algorithmic trading increased competition

2. **Parameter Misalignment**
   - GoScore thresholds too aggressive for evolved markets
   - Credit ratio assumptions outdated
   - Volatility patterns shifted

3. **Liquidity Changes**
   - Different market microstructure in 2025
   - Higher competition for premium
   - Changed option flow patterns

**Trade #5 - June 9, 2025, 11:20 AM**
```
Entry Conditions:
  - Underlying Price: $518.34
  - VIX: 21.7 (normal)
  - Liquidity Score: 0.74 ‚úÖ
  - Market Stress: 0.43 ‚úÖ
  - GoScore: 74.8 ‚úÖ

Decision: EXECUTE TRADE
Parameters:
  - Expected Credit: $21.05
  - Enhanced for evolved market: +10%

Outcome: LOSS
  - P&L: -$47.36
  - Loss Reason: Market microstructure change

  - Underlying Price: $524.67
  - VIX: 19.8 (low)
  - All filters: PASS

Decision: EXECUTE TRADE
Outcome: LOSS
  - P&L: -$52.18
  - Loss Reason: Gamma exposure miscalculation
  - Enhanced gamma hedging parameters misaligned
  - Modern option flow patterns different

Analysis: Gamma weight (0.85) too high for evolved markets
```

### **Maximum Drawdown Crisis - June 26, 2025**

**Critical Event Analysis:**

**Trade #23 - June 26, 2025, 10:30 AM**
```
Pre-Trade Conditions:
  - Running Drawdown: $38.45
  - Drawdown Limit: $2,250.00
  - Utilization: 1.7% (safe)

Entry Conditions:
  - Underlying Price: $519.89
  - VIX: 23.4
  - Market Stress: 0.59 ‚úÖ
  - GoScore: 75.1 ‚úÖ

Decision: EXECUTE TRADE (5 contracts)
Parameters:
  - Position Size: 5 (maximum allowed)
  - Expected Credit: $22.18 per contract
  - Total Risk: $111.40 per contract

OUTCOME: CATASTROPHIC LOSS
  - P&L: -$78.06 (per trade log)
  - Actual Loss: ~$390.30 (5 contracts)
  - New Drawdown: $428.75
  - Percentage of Limit: 19.1%

Crisis Factors:
  1. Position sizing too aggressive for evolved markets
  2. Market microstructure caused rapid delta movement
  3. Stop loss triggered simultaneously across all contracts
  4. Slippage amplified due to large position
```

**Risk Management Failure Analysis:**

1. **Position Sizing Error**
   - MaxPositionSize (12.5) rounded to 5 contracts
   - Too aggressive for evolved market volatility
   - Should have been capped at 2 contracts

2. **Correlation Risk**
   - Multiple contracts created correlation risk
   - Single adverse movement affected all positions
   - Risk multiplication not properly modeled

3. **Evolved Market Factors**
   - 2025 market dynamics different from training data
   - Algorithmic trading created faster movements
   - Traditional risk models became obsolete
