## üìä REAL PERFORMANCE BASELINE (Before Optimization)

### Current System Performance (284 trades, 26 days real data):
- **Total P&L**: $430.52 
- **Average per Trade**: $1.52
- **Win Rate**: 92.6% (263/284 trades)
- **Maximum Drawdown**: $59.86 ‚ö†Ô∏è **TOO HIGH**
- **Largest Single Loss**: $26.37 ‚ö†Ô∏è **TOO HIGH**
